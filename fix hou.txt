Houdini 14.0.467: Implemented a new HOM method, hou.Parm.setKeyframes(), that efficiently sets multiple keyframes on a parameter. 

Houdini 14.0.429: hou.playbar now has a setRealTimeSkipping() function to turn realtime playback skipping on or off. 

Houdini 14.0.400: Changed the return type of the hou.ui.displayFileDependencyDialog() HOM function. The function now returns both the source parameters and file patterns of the selected files. Callers of this function can now accurately expand the selected patterns by directly evaluating the returned source parameters (which handles channel references and context-specific variables like $OS). 

Houdini 14.0.394: Fixed a bug where drag-and-drop did not work for custom, standalone PyQt/PySide dialogs opened in Houdini. 

Houdini 14.0.345: Fixed a HOM bug where calling `hou.hipFile.load("myFile.hip", suppress_save_prompt=True)` did not update the Houdini window title with the loaded .hip file name if there were load warnings. 

Houdini 14.0.341: Fixed a bug where evaluating a parameter from HOM in the Python Shell would hang Houdini if the parameter had a Python expression containing a hou.hscript() call. 

Houdini 14.0.328: Added a hou.GeometryViewport.mapToScreen() function to convert from world space to screen space coordinates. 

Houdini 14.0.317: Fix a potential deadlock when the == operator is used on a hou.Attrib.
Fix a potential deadlock when multithreaded VEX called back into Python which in turns calls into VEX... 

Houdini 14.0.311: Added position(), setPosition(), size() and setSize() methods to the hou.FloatingPanel HOM class. 

Houdini 14.0.307:
Added an optional `output_index` argument to hou.SopNode.geometry() and hou.SopNode.geometryAtFrame() HOM functions for returning geometries from other outputs on the SOP node (i.e. for SOP nodes with multiple outputs).
Added convenience functions, hou.SopNode.inputGeometry() and hou.SopNode.inputGeometryAtFrame(), to return the incoming geometry connected to a specified input on the SOP node.
Added hou.Geometry.sopNodeOutputIndex() to return the output index on the SOP node that the geometry corresponds to. 

Houdini 14.0.276: Added a data() method to hou.Geometry which returns the geometry's binary data in bgeo format. 

Houdini 14.0.261: Fixed a bug where the hou.ui.selectFromTree() HOM function returned the selection even if the Cancel button was pressed in the chooser dialog. 

Houdini 14.0.254: Added Simple and Collapsible folder types to the hou.folderType HOM enumeration. 

Houdini 14.0.250: Significantly sped up findEdge python function, avoiding search through all primitives. 

Houdini 14.0.250: Fixed a bug where the enterEvent() and leaveEvent() method handlers in custom PySide/PyQt widgets were never called. This was the case for both Python Panel interfaces and standalone PySide/PyQt dialogs.

Houdini 14.0.243: Fixed a bug where changing the current frame in the playbar's frame field did not trigger user event callbacks registered with the HOM hou.playbar.addEventCallback() function. 

Houdini 14.0.242: Restored the HOM hou.playbar module in hython. Functions in the module that require the Houdini UI raise the hou.NotAvailable exception when executed in hython. 

The hou.Node.isTimeDependent HOM function no longer forces a cook on the queried node. The node will only cook when time dependencies are out of date. 

Houdini 14.0.221: You can now query for the UI stylesheet that is applied to Houdini by running this bit of Python code:

from PySide import QtGui
print QtGui.QApplication.instance().styleSheet() 

Houdini 14.0.212: Fixed a bug in Houdini's PySide package where the QtUiTools submodule was not available. 

Houdini 14.0.165: Fixed a bug where hou.applicationVersion() and hou.applicationVersionString() were not available when called from 123.py or pythonrc.py startup scripts.       

Add hou.ObjNode.localTransform() to directly get the local transform of an object node. 

Houdini 14.0.89: Added hou.NetworkBox.networkBoxes() and hou.NetworkBox.stickyNotes() as well as a 'recurse' argument to hou.NetworkBox.nodes().         

Houdini 14.0.75: hmath.buildTransform now takes an optional pivot value. 

Houdini 14.0.38: The add() and remove() methods of hou.PointGroup, hou.EdgeGroup, and hou.PrimGroup now accept a list of points/edges/primitives.         

Houdini 14.0.34: Added a function hou.ui.reloadViewportColorSchemes to force all 3DSceneColors files to be reloaded, making it easier to experiment with changing viewport color schemes.         

Houdini 13.5.192: Implemented hou.Node.creationTime() and hou.Node.modificationTime() methods.         

Attempting to avoid the case where the tool returned from hou.Shelf.tools could generate an hou.ObjectWasDeleted exception
